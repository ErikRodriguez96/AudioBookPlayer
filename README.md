# AudioBookPlayer

This application displays using fragments and frames in order to provide a consistent UX across portrait and landscape orientations. It is the first in a series of projects, with the ultimate goal being a fully fledged audio-book app.

We start with our list in portrait orientation, tap on a list item in order to bring focus on it

With the book focused, we can see more that due to our orientation it must take up the whole screen. Back out, and switch to landscape mode.

Now we can see that in landscape mode, we can view the list and a book at the same time. Tap on a book and it'll open it on the right-side frame.

With this book still selected, switch back to portrait mode.

You will see that it retains state information and you are the portrait focus/details frame for your selected book.
